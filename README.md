### How to use

- To see the work of program you must open MS Excel.
- To see the code you should use combination of keys: `Alt + F11`


### Problem that you may have and how to solve it

> **Problem with wrong path.**
You need to change the wrong path to the files for which you indicate MS Excel.


### **#1**
> #### Tasks
> 1. Given positive integers $m$ and $n$. Get all the natural numbers less than $n$, the square sum of digits of which is equal to $m$.
> 2. Fill piece selected by the user range of sheet by formula:  $\frac{21,8j}{(3,2i)^3}$, where $i$ - line number range, $j$ - column number range. If the resulting number exceeds 20, replace it with the value $\frac{11,3i}{j}$. Format obtained fragment with precision (number of decimal places) specified by the user.
> 3. Enter the matrix of integers. Find and bring a couple of elements of the matrix, in what module of differences is minimal.
> 4. Find all integers in the interval from $a$ to $b$, in which the number of divisors equal $k$.
> 5. Find all the simple irreducible fractions between 0 and 1: denominators $\leq$ 7 (fraction of given two natural numbers - the numerator and denominator).
> 6. Find $K$ first primes.
> 7. Suggest the user to enter a number, give a number of user-defined degree. Provide input negative numbers, rational numbers, incorrect data.
> 8. Enter the number and give it to the selected user number system (at least 65 of calculus).
> 9. At the rectangle $m×n$ falling consistently from the top $r$ rectangles with size  $k×p$ and different colors $(m,n\ge 15, k\leq7,p\leq5.)$. If the figure falls to the existing, it close them. Determine the area of each color, build a distribution chart of top colors. Demonstrate the process of filling the main rectangle.
> 10. Fill the rectangle $m × n$ on a spiral with user-defined cells in the selected by the user direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) only serial numbers with 3 to 5 dividers.
> 11. Find one of the options bypass user-defined rectangle size $m×n$ chess horse with user-defined point.
> 12. For a given matrix size m × n, consisting of 0 and 1, to find it a rectangular submatrices of some units of the maximum size (maximum height for the length multiplication).
> 13. Given a rectangular array of integer size $N * N$. Determine whether a given array magic square in which the sum of all elements in the rows, columns and main diagonals is equal.
> 14. Given a positive integer $n$ $(n <100)$.
      * Determine the number of $n$ ways payment using euro coins: 1, 2, 5 and paper bills in 10 euros.
      * Get all methods of payment (specify which coins and bills and how much should be used).
> 15. There are 10 dumbbells by weight: 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 2000 and 3000. How many combinations this set of dumbbells can make the weight $v$ in grams?
> 16. A set of sentences specified by user.  Every sentence ends with signs: ".", "!", "?". Between words are spaces or ",". Determine how many words in a sentence are werewolves, and whether the resulting number is simple.
> 17. CFO and chief accountant must congratulate ($N$) the staff  with New Year. Knowing time $t_{1i} $ to discharge premiums chief accountant $i$-th employee and time $t_{2i}$ to award the president of the $i$-th worker, develop algorithm with the least total loss of working time.
> 18. On the plane, given two coordinates. Find the lowest path between coordinates, if allowed to pass between adjacent points vertically, horizontally, and between certain user-defined points on the diagonal (possible passages defined matrix of passes, the aisle is permitted only on the coordinates for which value is 1).
> 19. Carry out content analysis of the words given by the user text. Construct a histogram for words that are found more than 1 time.

### **#2**
> #### Tasks
> 1. After harvest was formed $N$ bags, each of which is calculated grain quality (a coefficient) and its weight (all information about number bag, grain quality, mass contained in a text file). According to the user to select at least $M$ bags the best total weight of no more than $K$ kg to convert into flour, others - for feeding livestock. The results of the record to a new file.
> 2. Given three words. Print repeating in them letters.
> 3. Given the text in the file. Determine its words that begin and end with the same letter.
> 4. Given a positive integer $n$ $(n <1000)$. Print this number words.
> 5. Given the text in the file. Determine its the same words.
> 6. Import into MS Excel list of students. With the user-specified number $N$ to create all possible subgroups of students size $N$ and write them to a text file structure.
> 7. The file given matrix whose elements are the degree of infectiousness by certain areas (cells). For user-specified coordinates beginning and end of the movement, find the path with the lowest total infection.
> 8. Write a macros that converts all the text from a text file with a Roman numerals with Arabic numerals. Create another file in which all Arab numbers will be replaced by.

### **#3**
> #### Tasks
> 1. Write a program that solves system of linear equations of any size
 * Cramer's method
 * Gaus method
> 2. Develop an information system for solving equations of arbitrary degree (including finding complex solutions).
> 3. Develop an information system that simulates the work of lie detector based on input pulse and pressure of client.
> 4. Develop an information system for drawing lots of SOEI projects.

### **Exam Project**
####**Task**
> *Develop IC, which allows to evaluate different models of migration (Push-Pull model of migration, Diffusion migration model, Human capital model of migration, model of assimilation) for the EU and Ukraine, simulate migration flows under certain given conditions.*
